              <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12454'>GraphGPS [NeurIPS 2022]:</a>
              Developed a methodology and framework for building general, powerful, scalable (GPS) graph Transformers with linear complexity for graph representation learning and property prediction. This approach combined 3 main ingredients: (i) graph positional/structural encoding, (ii) local message-passing mechanism, and (iii) global attention mechanism. At the time of publishing GPS reached SOTA performance on 7 from 11 tested benchmarks.
              <br>-- An extended version, GPS++ developed in collaboration with Graphcore, won the first place in <a href='https://ogb.stanford.edu/neurips2022/results/'>OGB-LSC 2022</a> PCQM4Mv2 challenge.

              <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07729'>Taxonomy of graph datasets [LoG 2022]:</a>
              Many different types of GNN models have been developed, with many benchmarking procedures to demonstrate the superiority of one GNN model over the others, however there is a lack of systematic understanding of the underlying benchmarking datasets, and what aspects of the model are being tested. We provide a principled approach to taxonomize graph benchmarking datasets by carefully designing a collection of graph perturbations to probe the essential data characteristics that GNN models leverage to perform predictions.

              <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07432'>HGNet [IEEE MLSP 2021, Best Paper Award]:</a>
              Developed HGNet method, which for any two connected nodes guarantees existence of message-passing paths of at most logarithmic length w.r.t. the input graph size. Yet, under mild assumptions, its internal hierarchy maintains asymptotic size equivalent to that of the input graph. This construction outperforms conventional stacking of GCN layers particularly in tasks that require long-range interactions and in molecular property prediction benchmarks.

I developed Dr.VAE, a deep generative model based on variational autoencoders, that outperforms standard classification methods for 23 out of 26 tested FDA-approved drugs. It is the first approach to leverage modelling of drug effects on gene expression to improve the final predictions.
