# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a postdoctoral fellow investigating questions at the intersection of graph representation learning, graph signal processing, and geometric deep learning in the groups of [Guy Wolf (UdeM)](http://guywolf.org/) and [William L. Hamilton (McGill)](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/).

I completed my PhD at the University of Toronto in [Anna Goldenberg's group](http://goldenberglab.ca/"Goldenberg Lab"), where I developed latent-variable models for cancer treatment outcome prediction and drug perturbation effect modelling.

In fall 2018 I interned in Google Accelerated Science team (Mountain View, CA), where I developed machine learning models for predicting drug effects on cell phenotype from the drug molecular structure. I used SMILES variational autoencoders, convolutional nets, graph neural nets.

In 2016 I interned in Atomwise (San Francisco, CA), where I worked on 3D convolutional neural nets to predict small molecule binding to protein targets and for scoring of the 3D binding poses.
